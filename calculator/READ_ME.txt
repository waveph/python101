# Python Calculator

A command-line calculator built with Python that supports continuous calculations and robust input validation. This project was completed as part of Day 10 of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.

## Features

-   **Basic Operations:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   **Continuous Calculations:** Chain multiple operations together using the result of the previous calculation.
-   **Input Validation:** Ensures the user can only enter valid mathematical operations.
-   **Formatted Output:** Displays results cleanly, formatted to two decimal places.
-   **Modular Design:** Uses functions for getting operations and performing calculations, promoting clean and reusable code.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the `logo.py` file in the same directory as `calculator.py`.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.

## What I Learned

This project was a fantastic exercise in:
-   **Functions:** Refactoring repeated code into reusable functions (`operation`, `calculation`).
-   **Return Values:** Understanding how to `return` a value from a function and capture it in a variable.
-   **State Management:** Managing the `result` variable correctly to allow for continuous calculations.
-   **While Loops:** Using nested loops to handle user input and the main program flow.
-   **F-String Formatting:** Using f-strings to format output to a specific number of decimal places.

## ⚠️ Learning Project Disclaimer

This is a project from my Python automation learning journey. The code is a reflection of my progress and is not intended to be a final, production-ready application. It was built to practice specific concepts and may contain "messy" or inefficient code as part of the learning process.
