# Number Guessing Game

A fun and interactive command-line number guessing game built with Python. The player chooses a difficulty level and has a limited number of attempts to guess a secret number between 1 and 100.

## Features

-   **Difficulty Selection:** Choose between 'easy' (10 attempts) or 'hard' (5 attempts) modes.
-   **Input Validation:** Checks for out-of-range guesses and provides feedback.
-   **Game Loop:** The core logic is contained within a `while` loop that manages attempts.
-   **Replayability:** After each game, the user is prompted to play again or quit.
-   **Modular Design:** The game logic is separated into a dedicated `game()` function.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `main.py`).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a difficulty and start guessing!

## What I Learned

This project was a fantastic exercise in:
-   **Functions:** Encapsulating the main game logic into a reusable `game()` function.
-   **Loops and Conditionals:** Using `while` loops to manage game flow and `if/elif/else` for game logic.
-   **User Input:** Handling and validating user input from the command line.
-   **State Management:** Using a global variable (`u_attempts`) to track the number of remaining attempts.
-   **Randomization:** Using the `random` module to generate a secret number for each game.

## ⚠️ Learning Project Disclaimer

This is a project from my 30-day Python automation learning journey. The code is a reflection of my progress and is not intended to be a final, production-ready application. It was built to practice specific concepts and may contain "messy" or inefficient code as part of the learning process.
