# Python Quiz Application

A clean, object-oriented command-line quiz application built with Python. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of OOP principles, with a clear separation of concerns between data, logic, and presentation.

## Features

-   **Object-Oriented Design:** The application is structured using distinct classes (`Question`, `QuizBrain`) for modularity and maintainability.
-   **Data Transformation:** Converts raw data from a list of dictionaries into a list of `Question` objects.
-   **Dynamic Quiz Flow:** The `QuizBrain` class manages the quiz progression, asking questions and tracking the score automatically.
-   **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on whether an answer is correct or incorrect, along with the current score.
-   **Clean Code Structure:** The project is organized into multiple files (`main.py`, `quiz_brain.py`, `question_model.py`), each with a single, clear responsibility.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Ensure all three files (`main.py`, `quiz_brain.py`, `question_model.py`, and `data.py`) are in the same directory.
3.  Run the main script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to answer the quiz questions.

## What I Learned

This project was a pivotal exercise in:
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Solidified my understanding of how to design and implement classes and objects.
-   **Separation of Concerns:** Learned to structure an application so that each component has a distinct and isolated responsibility.
-   **Data Structures:** Practiced transforming raw data (dictionaries) into a more useful format (a list of objects).
-   **Application Flow Control:** Managed the main loop of an application using a class to handle the state and logic.

This project is a snapshot of my skills at a specific point in time. It serves as a key milestone in my journey, demonstrating my ability to build a well-structured, object-oriented application from scratch.
